# Simon Game

## User Story - which document what the user can do with your game

**As a Player -> Get ready to watch, remember, repeat!**

Players must repeat sequences of lights by pressing coloured pads in the correct order.
It's a fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you.

You will advance onto high levels as you repeat more patterns. The higher the level, the longer the pattern.

Score and high score will be kept track at the side of the game to show how far the player has climbed.
